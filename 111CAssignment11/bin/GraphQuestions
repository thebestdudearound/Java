2) a) Undirected, Disconnected, Acyclic
   b) Undirected, Connected, with simple cycle
   c) Undirected, Connected, with simple cycle
   
3) a) It could be either, in my opinion. It'd be directed if an edge has to point from the person/vertex that knows the second person/vertex,
	  but the second person/vertex doesn't necessarily have to know the first person/vertex back. It'd be undirected if it's assumed the acquaintance is mutual.
   b) The set of vertices represents people that some "vertex x" knows.
   c) A path represents how many people one person/vertex has to meet in order to meet the final person/vertex, but after the first person/vertex
      because that means that acquaintance has already been made. 
   d) To know the least amount of people I have to go through to come in contact with a certain other person/vertex.
   e) No. There won't be a path between every possible pair of people born since January 1, 1995.
