I actually got confused while working on this because Chapter 22 is mainly all about HashedDictionary.
For a long time I tried using that class to solve the problem but eventually gave up and just used HashMap.
I was able to find the frequencies and display them in alphabetical order which made it easier for me to find certain word frequencies. 
However, the assignment directions were so vague that I ended up changing my code completely at least 3 times. 
I ran out of time so I couldn't make it look as nice or just how I wanted to in general. I also messed up working with lowercases so words wouldnt repeat.
- Most Frequent Word: "the"
- "Alice": 395
- "Rabbit": 50
- "Cheshire": 7
- "Mad": 15
- "Hatter": 56
